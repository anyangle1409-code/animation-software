## Unreleased

### Codex — 2026-09-08 — `codex/fix-dumbbell-grip-position`

Purpose: keep dumbbell handles visibly enclosed by the fingers throughout
hand-held exercises.

- Moved the default one-hand equipment grip from inside the palm to the centre
  of the curled-finger loop, with mirrored left/right palm-facing offsets.
- Applied the anatomical default to the bicep curl and dumbbell shoulder press.
- Expanded animation tests to check both hands throughout the full repetition
  and detect a handle positioned inside the palm.

Verification: 81 local tests passed on the compatible Codex checkout;
`npm run typecheck` and `npm run build` completed successfully.
