# React / ReactDOM first-party migration — current handoff

Branch: `work/standalone-first-party-audit-20260927`

Latest fully verified checkpoint:

`3bc0d876f1e1e5bb8d52fa54780e43215050d1f6`

## Boundary

R3F source migration is complete. The live viewport uses the project-owned WebGL host and there are zero R3F/Drei source imports.

The current migration target is React/ReactDOM.

Do not replace React with another third-party UI framework. The target is project-owned DOM/lifecycle code backed by existing first-party stores/controllers.

## Verified checkpoint

At `3bc0d87`:

- Standalone prep verification: PASS
- full suite: 132 test files PASS, 2 skipped
- full tests: 939 PASS, 62 skipped
- production build: PASS
- final-character runtime-path gate: PASS
- dependency/resource/network gates: PASS
- Browser viewport smoke: PASS

## Completed React-migration stages

### R1 — framework-neutral Studio scene controller: COMPLETE

`src/viewer/studioSceneController.ts` now composes the existing project-owned runtimes for:

- static stage
- skeleton
- muscles
- equipment
- IK handles
- character
- orbit
- camera
- selection/handle transform gizmos

It subscribes directly to framework-neutral Studio/character stores and owns explicit creation, update, pointer registration and disposal.

### R2 — live scene composition switch: COMPLETE

The framework-neutral controller is the live first-party viewport scene path.

Verified consequences:

- redundant React scene composition wrappers were removed
- React scene-state/host context wrappers were removed where no longer required
- first-party browser smoke passes with the controller live
- exercise mechanics, IK, contacts, timing and rendering behavior were not changed to achieve the migration

Do not restore the removed React scene path as a production fallback.

## Framework-neutral foundations already available

### State and editor behavior

- `src/core/observableStore.ts`
- `src/editor/storeCore.ts`
- `src/editor/characterStoreCore.ts`
- `src/editor/keyboardController.ts`
- `src/editor/layoutState.ts`
- existing history/playback/comparison/diagnostic/generation logic

React hooks are temporary adapters, not the source of truth.

### Viewport/runtime

- `src/viewer/firstPartyViewportRuntime.ts`
- `src/viewer/studioSceneController.ts`
- `src/viewer/threeSceneHost.ts`
- `src/core/browserSceneSurface.ts`
- `src/viewer/sceneFrameDriver.ts`
- `src/viewer/scenePointerRouter.ts`
- `src/viewer/sceneHostTypes.ts`
- project-owned stage/scene/resource runtimes

The renderer, frame clock, clip tracking, pointer router, scene composition and disposal semantics no longer need React.

## React-owned surfaces that remain

### Remaining React child surfaces / bridge

- `src/main.tsx` — temporary ReactDOM bridge root beside the first-party shell
- `src/editor/App.tsx` — temporary portal bridge only
- remaining `src/editor/panels/*.tsx` surfaces other than Technique, Muscle, Comparison, Contact, Exercise, IK and Equipment

### Thin viewport DOM adapter

- `src/viewer/FirstPartyViewportHost.tsx`
- `src/viewer/Viewport.tsx`

The viewport adapter now owns only React DOM/effect lifetime; all renderer and scene composition work underneath it is plain TypeScript.

## Current stage

### R3 — editor DOM shell: IN PROGRESS

The outer editor shell, Toolbar, Timeline, Technique, Muscle, Comparison, Contact, Exercise, IK and Equipment panels are now live first-party DOM at `ea3b36d`:

- `src/editor/appShellDom.ts` owns the live Studio structure, tab buttons, panel visibility and stable child slots;
- `src/editor/toolbarDom.ts` owns the live Toolbar and subscribes directly to `studioStore`;
- `src/editor/timelineDom.ts` owns the live Timeline and subscribes directly to `studioStore`;
- `src/main.tsx` mounts the shell, Toolbar and Timeline directly under the first-party slot structure;
- `src/editor/App.tsx` is only a temporary portal bridge for the remaining React child surfaces;
- `src/editor/Toolbar.tsx` and `src/editor/Timeline.tsx` are removed after focused tests and Chromium parity passed;
- `src/editor/panels/techniquePanelDom.ts` is live only while the Technique tab is mounted;
- the Technique React wrapper is removed after focused/browser parity;
- `src/editor/panels/musclePanelDom.ts` is live only while the Muscles tab is mounted;
- the Muscle React wrapper is removed after focused/browser parity;
- Muscle local filters reset on remount and the existing `MusclePanel.css` remains owned by the first-party module;
- `src/editor/panels/comparisonPanelDom.ts` is live only while Compare is active, with explicit mount/disposal bound to `studioLayoutStore`;
- the Comparison React wrapper is removed after focused/browser parity;
- Comparison capture remains review-only and preserves both diagrams, snapshot metadata, selected-joint A/B/Δ readings and Clear behavior without changing document/history state;
- `src/editor/panels/contactPanelDom.ts` is live only while the left Contacts tab is active, with explicit mount/disposal bound to `studioLayoutStore`;
- the Contact React wrapper is removed after focused/browser parity;
- Contact diagnostics preserve the production solver inspection pipeline and route checkbox edits through the existing lock/history action;
- `src/editor/panels/exercisePanelDom.ts` is live only while the Exercise tab is active, with explicit mount/disposal bound to `studioLayoutStore`;
- the Exercise React wrapper is removed after focused/browser parity;
- Exercise tempo/grip edits continue through the existing regeneration/history actions with all metadata/readouts preserved;
- `src/editor/panels/ikPanelDom.ts` is live only while IK & locks is active, with explicit mount/disposal bound to `studioLayoutStore`;
- the IK React wrapper is removed after focused/browser parity;
- IK chain toggles, target/pole selection, viewport-handle visibility and lock edits continue through the existing store/history actions;
- `src/editor/panels/equipmentPanelDom.ts` is live only while Equipment is active, with explicit mount/disposal;
- Equipment selection, attachment wording, static object/socket editors and Reset socket preserve existing store/history actions and cm/degree formatting;
- the Equipment React reference is removed only after both required workflows passed at `ea3b36d`;
- a focused mount-lifecycle guard verifies validation stays dormant while Technique is inactive;
- Chromium verifies live shell/Toolbar ownership and Toolbar routing for generated candidates, view modes, backdrop, camera and undo/redo;
- full suite/build/provenance/dependency/resource/network gates pass.

The initial shell preparation commit exposed a test-only strict TypeScript cast; the typecheck gate stopped that checkpoint, the cast was corrected without runtime changes, and all later shell checkpoints are green. A Toolbar smoke assertion also initially expected a camera preset to survive `loadExercise`; the established store behavior correctly resets camera to `recommended`, so the parity assertion was corrected rather than changing runtime semantics. The IK preparation also exposed two test-harness assumptions: the shell tab is labelled `IK & locks`, and a smoke probe cannot assume an IK chain starts enabled. Both assertions were corrected to follow established runtime state; IK mechanics were not changed.

Next exact increment: **Character live switch**, after preparation CI passes.

The prepared `characterPanelDom.ts` reads the framework-neutral character/Studio stores. Its focused tests cover bind selection, import/view switch, mapping edit/save/removal and disposal. Chromium compares its detached initial controls with the live React Character reference. The React panel remains live at this preparation checkpoint.

1. confirm both workflows for the preparation commit;
2. add a Character mount bound to `leftTab === 'character'`, remove simultaneous React rendering and cover mount/disposal;
3. extend Chromium smoke to assert live ownership and import/bind/mapping behavior;
4. after both live workflows pass, remove the redundant `CharacterPanel.tsx`;
5. continue Joint/Grip and right-side panels, then viewport adapter, bridge and root.

Direct R3F/Drei source imports are zero, and direct React/ReactDOM source import statements total 12. Five runtime packages remain declared: `@react-three/drei`, `@react-three/fiber`, `react`, `react-dom`, `three`.

Use `studioStore.subscribe/getState` and `studioLayoutStore.subscribe/getState`; do not create a second state model.

### R4 — React root removal

When all live editor/viewport surfaces are first-party DOM/lifecycle code:

- replace `createRoot(...).render(<App />)`;
- remove temporary React hook adapters;
- remove React/ReactDOM source imports;
- set one-way import ceilings to zero;
- remove React/ReactDOM packages only after build/browser parity passes.

## Acceptance for every increment

- focused unit tests for extracted controller/model behavior
- typecheck
- full suite
- production build
- current standalone/provenance/network gates
- Chromium browser smoke for user-visible/lifecycle changes
- no migration-threshold weakening

## Preserve

- CSS/classes and visible editor layout unless a separate product change explicitly authorizes a redesign
- keyboard shortcuts
- timeline/playback semantics
- camera/orbit/picking/gizmo behavior
- accessibility-relevant labels/button semantics
- current exercise and biomechanical behavior

## Do not

- mix React removal with Three.js math/renderer replacement
- replace React with another third-party framework
- create a parallel state architecture
- change exercise data/mechanics to accommodate UI migration
